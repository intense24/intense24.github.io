										<h4>Why InteNSE?</h4>
										Code is the most recent modality of interest in the Machine Learning (ML) domain. Learning-based techniques have been shown to improve and revolutionize software engineering and analysis tasks, including code completion and synthesis, code captioning and documentation, code search and clone detection, recovering variable names and types, and software testing, verification, and debugging. Recent studies have even shown the great potential of neural models of code for decomposing the natural language reasoning problem into programmatic steps and solving it by executing the generated programs. However, most of these techniques consider ML as closed-box, i.e., only considering the final performance of the developed models to evaluate their effectiveness. Without a systematic and rigorous approach to interpreting neural models concerning code modality, one cannot validate their actual performance, generalizability, decision certainty, if/how they are learning what they are supposed to do, and why they make particular decisions.										
									</p>
									<p>
										InteNSE is an interdisciplinary workshop for research
										at the intersection of ML and Software Engineering
										(SE). The InteNSE workshop aims to promote the required 
										<b>awareness</b> and <b>knowledge</b> necessary for both research
										communities to interpret neural models of code and
										design robust neural models for software analysis
										and engineering. The InteNSE program will combine
										academia and industry in a quest for well-founded
										practical solutions. We invite international experts
										in academia and industry with both ML and SE
										backgrounds to (1) discuss their research, (2)
										evaluate prior ML4Code research, and (3) identify
										the roadmap for the research domain. 
									</p>
									<!-- <p>
										<h4>What is Neural Software Engineering?</h4> 
										Due to recent computational advancements in Deep Learning (DL), data-driven tools and algorithms have 
										become an inseparable part of different research areas in the Software Engineering.
										DL has shown to improve and revolutionize many SE tasks such as code manipulation,
										program repair, program synthesis, software testing, debugging, and symbolic analysis. 										
										We consider the neural software engineering (NSE) as a broad research area at the intersection of
										machine learning (ML) and software engineering (SE).
									</p>
									<p>
										<h4>Why is it important to develop robust and interpretable neural software engineering?</h4>
										 Currently, most research in software engineering treat ML models as
										 closed-box and opaque. However, this treatment brings many challenges to the
										 interpretability and robustness of NSE.
										 <ul>
											<li>
												DL models are notorious for adversarial example attacks
												that can mislead neural models to make an unintended prediction.
												In the NSE setting, such vulnerability can result in subtle,												
												and often unnoticed bugs in software. Without
												ensuring the adversarial robustness, there is a risk
												that neural models perform poorly on real codebase.
											</li>
											<li>
												Closed-box models can only be evaluated through generic metrics. 
												As a result, one cannot truly determine and validate if the superiority of a new
												model is due to better embedding of
												code, fine-tuning, the architecture, or data leakage.
												Without	such understanding, the community only blindly
												progresses on designing better neural models for software analysis.
											</li>
											<li>
												Since the ultimate end user of NSE is software developers,
												a neural model that automates specific tasks without giving
												convincing high-level explanations to
												developers about the <i>whys</i> and the <i>hows</i> in the automation
												process, would be unsatisfactory and often useless in practice. 												
											</li>
										 </ul>
									</p>
									<br><h4>What is the goal of InteNSE workshop?</h4> 
										<table cellspacing="10">
											<tr>
											  <td>
												While SE community needs to enforce <i>Interpretability</i> and
												<i>Robustness</i> as the primary evaluation metics,
												two crucial prerequisites still need to be met: (1) Awareness and (2) Knowledge.
												At InteNSE, we aim to advance the state of ML4SE research by considering four main components
												keynotes, research papers, hackathon, and a panel.
												The first two components of the workshop aim to contribute to the knowledge
												about different interpretability techniques and robust developments of NSE.
												The latter two components aim to foster awareness for the SE community about
												the pitfalls of ignoring interpretability and robustness of NSE.
												Co-located with ICSE'23, InteNSE'23 will include <b>1) two keynotes</b>, <b>2) research paper presentations</b>, <b>3) hands-on Hackathon</b>, and <b>4) the panel of expert discussions</b>.

									<h3>Workshop Components</h3>
									<p>InteNSE consists of the following four components to enable the knowledge and awareness concerning the interpretability and robustness of ML4Code.</p>
									<p><b>(1) Keynotes:</b>
										We have two awesome keynote speakers,
										<i>Dr. Michael Pradel (University of Stuttgart)</i> and <i>Dr. Kla
											Tantithamthavorn (Monash University)</i> who will discuss their
											insights on ML4Code robustness and interpretability. The details of
											the talks will appear in the program. 
									</p>
									<p><b>(2) Research Papers:</b> We accept three types of papers: </p>
									<ul>
										<li><i>Full Workshop Papers: </i>
											4-6 pages papers related to the workshop's topics of interest that are (1) presenting novel research ideas and preliminary results or (2) interpreting or assessing the robustness of existing ML4Code models.
										</li>										
										<li><i>Posters: </i>
											2 pages papers related to the workshop's topics of interest that are (1) proposing a statement of vision or position or (2) presenting novel ideas without any preliminary results. For the second category of papers, authors should clearly indicate their evaluation plan.
										</li>										
										<li><i>Journal First Papers:</i>
											The papers accepted to appear at IEEE Software XAI4SE special issue are welcome to present their papers at the workshop. The authors of journal first papers at other top software engineering venues, including TSE, TOSEM, EMSE, and JSS are also welcome to represent their published work at InteNSE. Journal first papers do not appear in the workshop proceeding.
										</li>

									</ul> -->
									<p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black;">
										Papers with negative results are also welcome.
										Examples of negative results are: interpretability techniques that did not reveal meaningful knowledge or adversarial attacks against which the model was robust. 
									</p>
									
									<p><b>(3) Hackathon: </b>
										InteNSE offers a unique Hackathon-style experience to in-person participants
										interested in exploring the interpretability and robustness of neural
										models of code. Workshop organizers will set up the tool set and
										framework required for the hackathon, including ready-to-use Jupyter notebooks.
										The participants will (1) assess <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> the closed-box neural
										models of code make specific decisions and (2) evaluate the robustness of such
										models against adversarial inputs.
									</p>
									<p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black;">
										Participation in the Hackathon and accessing the tool is only available for 
										<b>in-person</b> registered attendees.
										Participants are required to have their own laptops to use the tools. A separate call for participation in Hackathon will be announced later.
									</p>
									<p><b>(4) Expert Panel: </b>
										The expert panel will comprise people from academia and industry with
										a research background in neural software analysis.
										The main theme of the discussion would be the state of the ML4Code
										in academia and industry, the importance of interpretability and
										explainability of such models to move the research frontiers, and
										potential risks concerning the robustness of neural models of code.
										The list of panelists and details about the discussions will appear
										in the program. 
									</p>
									<p style="padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black;">
										At the end of the panel, we will identify open challenges and a
										promising roadmap in advancing the role of interpretability and
										robustness in neural software engineering research.
